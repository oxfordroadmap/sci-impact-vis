### [Oxford Roadmapping](https://oxon8.com/) Data Scientist

Han-Teng Liao works across disciplines to contribute to the better managing by data-driven design for climate and sustainable development challenges, inspired by [managing by design](https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5626&context=lkcsb_research).  His journey across disciplines and with the open source software, open content, open data, open science, and open innovations around the world has strengthened his belief that evidence-based policies can make a difference through the divergent and convergent thinking processes of problem-solving and story-telling. 
## Biography

Han-Teng Liao (IEEE member; DPhil. Oxon.) was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1976. He received a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering ([NTUEE](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/about1.php)) and a bachelor's degree in foreign languages and literature from National Taiwan University in 2000. He received a master's degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering ([NTUCSIE](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/)) and a master's degree in Journalism ([NTUJournalism](http://www.journalism.ntu.edu.tw/Journalism/Default.html)) from the same university in 2004. After working in open source and open content movement in Taiwan, he pursued and received a DPhil. (Ph.D.) degree (Oxford Internet Institute, [OII](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/han-teng-liao)) from the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom in Information, Communication and Social Sciences.

In his early-adult life in Taiwan, after working as a project manager for the Open Source Software Foundry (OSSF) at the Information Science Institute of Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan, and he served his compulsory military service as a battalion-level political warfare officer and acting company commander.  The **Taiwan Merit Scholarships (on Digital Content)** allowed him to purse a Ph.D. study on open content dynamics at the University of Oxford.  

In 2014, he received a **D.Phil (Ph.D.) in Information, Communication and Social Sciences. The doctoral thesis examines the governance and performance of **open collaboration** across different national, regional and linguistic borders.

Postdoctoral work mainly focuses on evidence-based policy research. From 2015 to 2016, he was the first researcher at the United Nations University Institute for Computing and Society (UNU-CS). Before that, he also served as a Yahoo researcher at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Washington, DC, and a researcher at the School of Foreign Service in Berlin, Germany. Summer fellows at the **Alexander von Humboldt University** Institute for Internet and Society do think tank-type research related to the Internet. From 2017 to 2023, he worked as an associate professor at Sun Yat-sen University Nanfang College, in Guangzhou, China. He also founded the Higher Education Impact Assessment Center (also known as _GDT for Green Digital Transformation_) and served as its director. The center produced the highest numbers of indexed documents, featuring multi- and cross-disciplinary, involving internal collaborators (from management, electrical engineering, computer science, accounting, public administration, and foreign languages departments) and external researchers, with the purpose to advance the understanding of green digital transformation implications for the Greater Bay Area.  He co-founded the ESG Data-Driven Decision Lab.  He and his students founded the university's IEEE student chapter. He also facilitated multi-disciplinary research for the university's UN academic impact.

He chaired and organized the the “Sustainable development innovation design and Internet Ecosystems” conference for the 2019 World Eco-Design Conference (WEDC) held in Conghua, Guangzhou, China, and edited the report titled "**Internet Eco-Design for Good**". He also chaired and organized the 2011 China Internet Research Conference (**Chinese Factors in Internet Development: Global Public Goods, National Policies, and Private Interests**) held in Washington, DC, USA.

He received a Certificate of Merit at the 2021 IEEE TEMSMET Conference in recognition of his leadership in research efforts on **CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)** and **ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) Reporting**. 

Since 2023, recognizing the need for trustworthy data sources, visualization, and stories for decarbonization, he founded Oxford Roadmapping to build roadmaps and tools that can help organizations and individual to solve climate and sustainable development challenges.  With early outcomes such as visualization prototypes and green digital transformation toolkits, the start-up aims to advance the Industry-Academia collaboration for eco-design business ecosystems, especially regarding the ways in which platforms such as cloud computing (e.g. Software as a Service), artificial intelligence (AI) and big data can advance sustainable development goals (primarily carbon neutrality-related climate goals) by monitoring, analyzing, evaluating and designing key indicators that define and concretize the “working consensus” for applying emerging and future technologies in an integrated, auditable, and responsible way.  Han-Teng Liao believes that the voluntary divergent and convergent design thinking processes are critical to ensure the meaning and well-being of stakeholders for any data-driven green digital transformation projects.
